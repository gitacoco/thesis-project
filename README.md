In-class Feedback (Thanks the support from Lee Kuczewski): 
- Focus on the data driven visualization pieces — the other drivers (such as tools of Computer Vision and AR) — might be secondary in terms of scope (but could provide insights as well). =
- It’s important to think about other personas such as the director of the museum — The director might have a different set of needs in terms of finding specific information on this app while giving a presentation to others (such as funders). 
- The final question was around feasibility and focusing in on a place to start.
