#### Concept Alternatives
1. Educational Data Interactive System in VR Environments

## The Field Trip on Feb 4 
I visited National Wetland Museum of China today to get some insights from settings in the real museum.

## Storyboard and Wireframe
### Updated on Tue Feb 1

#### In-class Feedback (Thanks the support from Lee Kuczewski): 
- Focus on the data driven visualization pieces — the other drivers (such as tools of Computer Vision and AR) — might be secondary in terms of scope (but could provide insights as well). =
- It’s important to think about other personas such as the director of the museum — The director might have a different set of needs in terms of finding specific information on this app while giving a presentation to others (such as funders). 
- The final question was around feasibility and focusing in on a place to start.
- Sherry Manzar: Those birds clusters look like a great use case for the t-SNE technique discussed in the Seth Kranzler video!

### In-class Feedback
#### Daniel's Response
#### Chat Comments
- Daniel Sauter: Dominant color research, looks like you and Luella need the same to implement.
- David Malary: I really like the color aspect! I wonder if you can compare that with the habitats, to see if birds of similar colors live in similar habitats or not?
- Justin Kraus: I appreciate the specificity of wetland birds. I think maybe a primer on what type of bird generally inhabits this habitat would provide relevant early context.
- Serry Manzar: I really like how each interaction has a purpose and contributes to a clear story.
- Lee Kuczewski: Beautiful interactivity, Zhibang! I love how clear this is regarding the ecosystem approach - with a focus on accessibility. Great use of the evolutionary tree as bringing the species together.
### External Discussion
- #### [Liwenhan Xie](https://shellywhen.github.io/), a PhD student at HKUST working on data visualization
On the gallery view, a 'sort by' feature could be added. A user could change the order of the birds or reorganize them by using this feature. This feature provides the possibility of layout in multiple dimensions, such as sorting by name, color, conservation status, an analogue layout of the physical setting and so on. In each dimension of sorting, a specific encoding strategy embedded in the stroke and corresponding legends could be created.

- #### [Yuning Chan](https://alienyuning.com/), a graduate student in the IDE program at Royal College of Art
Yuning has a background in Environmental Science, and she focuses on the field of biodesign. She provides valuable suggestions from the perspective of living organisms and nature. First, she thinks the conversations not only could be technically but also be a transformation of identities between humans and species/specimens. We could provide humans an opportunity to observe and understand the world through the eyes/lens of a bird, traveling through different worlds. Also, she points that naïve analogies (Hofstadter et al. 2013) could be used to eliminate the barriers between people and data visualization and make the interface to be less like a 'Database'. One of the forms of naïve analogies is to imitate the bird relations, such as food chain and ecology relationships, through the interactivity of social media platforms in human society, which builds proximity and enhances comprehension via familiar formula or language. Naïve analogies are important because Yuning believes the step before "making things more accessible" is to encourage people to access it, to spark their interests.
