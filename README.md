## The Field Trip on Feb 4 
I visited National Wetland Museum of China today to get some insights from settings in the real museum.

### Updated on Tue Feb 1

#### In-class Feedback (Thanks the support from Lee Kuczewski): 
- Focus on the data driven visualization pieces — the other drivers (such as tools of Computer Vision and AR) — might be secondary in terms of scope (but could provide insights as well). =
- It’s important to think about other personas such as the director of the museum — The director might have a different set of needs in terms of finding specific information on this app while giving a presentation to others (such as funders). 
- The final question was around feasibility and focusing in on a place to start.
- Sherry Manzar: Those birds clusters look like a great use case for the t-SNE technique discussed in the Seth Kranzler video!
